<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp" target="_blank" title="JavaScript specification">
JavaScript</a></strong> is the programming language of HTML and the Web.<br>
JavaScript is often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications.
The vast majority of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.<br><br>

<p>Why Study JavaScript?<br><br>

JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:<br>
<ol>
<li>HTML to define the content of web pages</li>
<li>CSS to specify the layout of web pages</li>
<li>JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages</li>
</ol>
JavaScript and Java are completely different languages, both in concept and design.
JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995, and became an ECMA standard in 1997.
ECMA-262 is the official name of the standard. ECMAScript is the official name of the language.
You can read more about the different JavaScript versions in the chapter JS Versions.
